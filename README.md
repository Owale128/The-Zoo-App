# The Zoo - This is a school project! ðŸ˜ƒ

This project is a React application that displays and manages animal data. The user can navigate between the home page, a list of animals and detailed information about each animal. Data is retrieved from an API service and stored locally. The function to feed animals updates their status in the application.
